An organization and management tool for students. At its core, it is just a text editor. However, the system will read through the text flies, and pick up relevant data and render them. 
To Do:
- [ ]  Figure out the website design.
- [ ]  Date-wise text editor.
- [ ]  Global text editor
- [ ]  Global file explorer
- [ ]  Collect all todo list tasks from all text editors using regex and put it all in an object.
    - [ ]  Each todo item in object has properties. Such as day, assignment, etc.
- [ ]  A foreign page, which has a seperate text doc that is synced with backend. If the user will have a tag. The server can select people of particular tag, and send them all a bit of text in that foreign page. They can of course add todo lists to that page. Those ToDos will have foreign tag in them. Hence, the server can add tasks to userâ€™s task list. It could be assignments, and the head of that tag group could be responsible for adding that assignment as a task for all those people.
